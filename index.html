								<p><strong>Myer-Briggs Test</strong><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/96491c3d69343"><span style="color:#a48aba"> results:</span></a></p>

								<p><strong>Creativity Test results:</strong></p>
								<img src="images/creativity-test.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="330" />		
								<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</strong></p>	
								<p>These test results give me a better understanding of my potential role in group settings as well as how I would approach individual work. This may be beneficial in the long run when I am job seeking and want to find a job that fits my working and learning style. These results also give me an idea of the type of people I am able to work my best with in order to be productive and be satisfied with the products. However, they aren’t always accurate and discovering new things about myself my own way is equally as important. After all, people can change drastically even over a short amount of time. </p>			
								<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></p>	
								<p>According to my Myer-Briggs test results, I am the initiator in group settings and may take on a supporting lead role as I am intuitive but also turbulent. I may be more of a listener and take into consideration for other group members ideas as I am less creative than your average person according to my creativity test. However, I may take this literally or try to improve my creativity and try harder to think of ideas and contribute new material for the team.</p>
								<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></p>
								<p>I may seek for a more assertive individual to fill in that required leadership role. As I am more of a visual learner, having individuals that possess different learning styles such as auditory or tactile may be more beneficial and easier to produce ideas. My creativity is also lacking compared to the typical person, therefore a more creative and original individual may be able to generate ideas completely different to mine. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/idealjob.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51830300?type=standout#searchRequestToken=12a28ca7-33ba-482e-a87a-35d836c2a85c"><span style="color:#a48aba">Link</span></a> to the job advertisement.</p>
								<p>It appeals to me as this job is mainly based on the cyber security field as well as software development and quality assurance. Although I have very little knowledge in this area, I believe this career path can be very intriguing and captivating as there may produce many unique experiences during my time of work. 
									As this particular company currently possess’ businesses branches all over the world with countries in Asia and in the United Kingdom. Therefore travelling to these countries for projects could also be a potential and who doesn’t want to travel around the world. This advertisement also mentions the involvement in mobile app testing which is something I am interested in and would love to explore that more. They also offer opportunities in cryptography, artificial intelligence, biometric and identity verification technologies among many others. </p>
								<p>The qualifications for this job is the completion of a tertiary degree in software engineering, computer science or a similar discipline with high quality results. 
									The skills required are having an understanding of software engineering concepts, methodologies, practices and Software Development Life Cycles. As for experience, they are looking for a candidate who is familiar with hands on programming and software testing whether that be from an internship or academic project. They are also looking for an individual who is keen for a challenge and willing to further their knowledge and skills. Furthermore, team work and communication skills are a must for this job.</p>
								<p>Besides the obvious lack of a degree in either of those tertiary degrees, I believe I possess the individual drive and confidence to take on any given challenge with all the experience and knowledge I have. 
									Group work is essential for this job and I believe I am able to utilise my communication and collaboration skills to the fullest when required.</p>
								<p>For the academic qualifications, I am quite unsure whether a tertiary degree in IT will suffice, therefore to meet the requirements, transferring to a different course whether that be software engineering or computer science may be required. Internships in the future will be a major benefit for gaining more experience and knowledge especially being in a workplace setting. I could further my knowledge and skills by taking on self-motivated projects which can also be to challenge myself for possible future situations. 
									Networking can also be crucial in landing your desired internship, therefore enjoying the internship more and being more invested. Networking can also result in improved collaboration and communication skills which are essential for experience as this specific job consists of a lot of group projects and collaborative thinking.  </p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IT.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p font-size="50px"><strong>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong></p>
								<p>	Personally, I have not been exposed much to the world of IT and technology in general. The main reason IT sparked my interest was purely based on my large lack of knowledge in this field. The influence of Technology in the world is also increasing over the years and I would love to be involved and have a deeper understanding of its massive influence. Possessing a degree in Information technology may also result with many career opportunities in the near future. 
									I have also recently been interested in PC gaming and with this comes my realisation of how much I do not understand how a computer or programming systems work therefore gaining more interest in IT.</p>
								<p><strong>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong></p>
								<p>	Well, the initials IT are literally in the name of the university so it kind of felt fitting. The IT program at RMIT seemed very informative and intriguing as this course provides knowledge in IT which were my main interests, such as learning python and learning how to do basic coding (for e.g. websites etc). Other than that, I live quite close to the university as well and always pass it when going to the city. The campus always looks very lively and is quite modern which I prefer.</p>
								<p><strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></p>
								<p>	I’m not exactly sure what to expect, but I’m hoping I’ll gain an in-depth understanding of the functions and systems within computers and other tech innovations. With my very basic knowledge about IT, I may be expecting some to learn python, writing and debugging programs overall. I am also expecting to gain more knowledge in the business field, more specifically marketing and logistics that is involved with technology.

								<h2 class="major" style="font-size:larger;">Project Idea: 'Petrol Price App'</h2>
								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The purpose of this app Petrol Prices is to reduce the cost of petrol for the common consumer by giving them a map of the nearest petrol stations with the lowest fuel prices.
									This app may be used by users when their car fuel tank is empty and requires to be filled. For the average Australian motorist, this may be as frequent as once a week, twice a week for the heavy drivers and once a fortnight. The user will find this app efficient to navigate so that any user of any age should be able to use, as there are drivers of all ages. Although this app may not be an absolute necessary app in every individuals life, it is efficient and users will appreciate the convenience and benefits it provides. As all individuals strive to save money and look for the cheapest or best deals, this app may be of use to everyone. This app idea was also slightly inspired by the private Facebook page where users will post images on the timeline of ticket inspectors and share where they are lurking to the other members of the page. However this app is just a little more technical and includes more helpful features. 
									
									</p>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>This app is largely beneficial in the sense that it saves users money which is always valued. It also saves them time and effort to go to their local petrol stations in order to find the cheapest fuel, which in the end will cost them more fuel to be lost. As everyone is well aware of how costly it is to buy and own a car and creating an app to ease users financially may be very rewarding as the creator. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Picture 1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<P>This app would notify the users in Perth of the lower prices which will help users save on petrol. For example, this graph shows the drastic price change within 3 days. For a common consumer, they initially could be paying $1.55 (median) x 25L = $38.75 per week and $2015 a year maximum, however a consumer of this app would be aware of the frequent prices drops and therefore would be paying $1.22 x 25L = $30.5 /week and $1586, saving a total of $429. This app could save hundreds of dollars being spent on petrol every year. </P>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>This app will not only share prices of fuel to the local users, but it will include many other features that may also be of use and interrelate to the apps main purpose. 
								<p><strong>These features include:</strong></p>
								<p>&emsp; •	 A filter may be applied when seeking the lowest prices possible in their area. The lowest priced fuel within the user’s 5km radius may appear on their screen immediately after opening the app to save time. Radius can be changed in settings to accommodate to the users as much as possible. By having a wider radius, the user may save more money by locating the cheapest petrol prices near them instead of paying for the average price (1.385/L) or an even more expensive petrol that is closer to them. </p>
								<p>&emsp; •	Shows all nearby petrol stations using an icon perhaps, as well as the distance between the user’s location and the nearby petrol stations on a map including users’ current location in live time </p>
								<p>&emsp; •	Provides all users with the ability to change and update fuel prices throughout the day. To avoid false prices being submitted, the app will only allow the price to be set </p>	
								<p>&emsp; •	In addition, it will display the company of these petrol stations. This may be of concern for some drivers, for example, the Coles express petrol stations may be preferred as they allow customers to use their Flybuys card to pay or earn points</p>	
								<p>&emsp;	•	Informs users on which petrol stations are busy and which ones aren’t. The app will display the rate of how busy the petrol stations are, however can only account for the users that possess this ap. It will inform the user how many other Petrol Price app users have come across their nearby petrol station </p>	
								<p>&emsp;	•	Allows users to filter the type of fuel (e.g. Unleaded petrol, premium unleaded, diesel, etc) they are seeking therefore keeping the information that is displayed to be clear and efficient </p>	
									
								<p> <strong>Potential obstacles that may be anticipated:</strong></p>	
								<p>&emsp;	•	Petrol station companies will be against this app as they may lose a significant number of customers and therefore money</p>	
								<p>&emsp;	•	As this is a mobile app, it may seem like it is encouraging users to go on their phones while driving which could be extremely hazardous. May include a warning upon opening this app to make the user aware of the dangers every time </p>	
								<p>&emsp;	•	Users may submit false prices and therefore upset other users</p>	
								<p>	I am still quite unsure of how to prevent users from obstructing the app and taking advantage of it in order to mislead other users. There completely ruining the purpose of this app and could completely destroy users interest in using this app. However a simple solution could be to allow users to upload prices for a specific petrol station. This would allow users who are interested in those petrol stations to determine the most common price. A voting system could also be applied where users who have been to these petrol stations and witnessed the prices, to vote on prices that are true and accurate. </p>	
									</p>
								<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
								<p>This app will require many different software’s to be fully functional and working. As this app consists of a lot of interaction between the users and the app itself, the software will be more technical and must be more flexible in terms of the internal system for it to work. Some of the tools that will be required are Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop the necessary software as well as Java and JavaScript for programming purposes required during the development. Integrated Development Environment is one of the many software applications where python is utilised in order to program and development the apps software. 

									To skip all the technical requirements for this app, an app development software could be used instead, some of these include: Appery.io, Appy pie, Swing2App just to name a few. 
									
									</p>
								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
								<p>There are many skills required to create this app to his fullest potential. These will include the more technical skills as well as those required in group settings. 
									Having an in-depth knowledge and understanding of how to use python will be crucial in the development of this app as this skill is what will build and construct the main software program to allow the app to fully function. This includes any sort of higher-level programming language skills to further develop the program for this app and any app in general. 
								<p>	Along with the ability to perform programming and execute any sort of programming language, is the understanding of user-design and user experience for further development and improvements required for the app to run correctly and efficiently. This skill is beneficial as it enables you to acknowledge the importance of user feedback in order to determine the updates that are highest in demand and are the most necessary. 
									Design system skills will be beneficial in terms of the apps visual appearance during its usage including the apps icon. </p>
								<p>	When developing this app, a group of individuals may be required to successfully launch this app. Therefore teamwork skills such as, leadership skills, communication skills, problem solving and many more. These will help with the cohesion of this project and allow the development run smoothly and also possibly enhance the apps features. 
									</p>
								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>The overall outcome of this app being a success will be gratified and satisfied users. Consumers will notice the amount of money they have saved on petrol through this app and therefore appreciate its worth and purpose. Users will ultimately feel more financially relieved, as owning a car and maintaining it can be costly. </p>
								<p>	In the direction of making profit for this app if it is successful, could potentially be including ads in the app and gain revenue. Another method could be charging either  android or iOS users to have to purchase the app once the reputation of it increases and expands.
